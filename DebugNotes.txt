Looks like Ubuntu has a process claiming the RTL-SDR:
can verify this by running th following command:
sudo rmmod dvb_usb_rtl28xxu
and see if it works. It it does,
then you can make the change permanent (after reboot) by creating "rtlsdr.conf" in "/etc/modprobe.d" and put 
blacklist dvb_usb_rtl28xxu


Other usefull commands:
lsusb
rtl_test
